# PWM Project

Welcome to the PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) Project repository! This project showcases the design, simulation, and analysis of PWM circuits using industry-standard tools. Whether you're a student, hobbyist, or professional, you'll find valuable resources here for understanding and experimenting with PWM techniques.

## What's Inside?

This repository contains:

- **Schematic Files (`.asc`)**: Circuit schematics for PWM designs, compatible with LTspice and similar simulation tools.
- **Simulation Output (`.raw`, `.op.raw`)**: Raw data files generated from circuit simulations, useful for waveform and performance analysis.
- **Log Files (`.log`)**: Detailed logs from simulation runs, including error messages, warnings, and simulation parameters.
- **Frequency Analysis (`.fft`)**: Frequency domain data for evaluating the spectral characteristics of PWM signals.

## Project Structure

- `Draft1.fft`, `Draft1.raw`, `Draft1.op.raw`, `Draft1.log`: Frequency analysis, simulation data, and logs for the first draft of the PWM circuit.
- `Draft2.asc`, `Draft2.raw`, `Draft2.op.raw`, `Draft2.log`: Schematic, simulation data, and logs for the second draft, reflecting improvements or alternative designs.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. **Open the schematic files** (`.asc`) in [LTspice](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html) or your preferred circuit simulation tool.
3. **Run or review simulations** to explore PWM behavior, analyze waveforms, and study frequency responses.

## Requirements
- [LTspice](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html) or a compatible circuit simulation tool.

## Why PWM?
Pulse Width Modulation is a fundamental technique in electronics for controlling power delivery, signal generation, and motor speed. This project provides hands-on examples and data to help you:
- Understand PWM principles
- Analyze time and frequency domain characteristics
- Compare different PWM circuit designs
